Figure out what libraries have been used:
  Looked at angular4 branch in file:
    - attempted to get 'BsDropdownModule' and 'ToolTip' module from
      'ngx-bootstrap' but commented out

    - got 'NgbModule' from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap'
    - got 'ModalModule' from 'ngx-bootstrap'

    Not sure yet if needed:
    - got 'FormsModule' from '@angular/forms'
    - got 'HttpModule' and 'RequestOptions' from '@angular/http'

    - using bootstrap

Looking at master to understand thought process:
* : means important commit 
- : means not so important
  * Commit 3:  Start FSETable
               Basic table that can be sorted ascending and descending order // ANYA: "filterable, sortable, editable table"
  - Commit 4:  Integrated gulp
               Gulp can compile sass files, uglify and compress js files and
               much more. Its like pipes in bash.
               // ANYA: I'm afraid this is not a very acurate description. For Part II, please have a paragraph on gulp explaining what it is and how it work.
  * Commit 5:  Integrated browser-sync for cells
               Cells are editable
               Curr files: fse-table.component.html, fes-table.component.ts,
               fse-table-content.ts - this is for sorting
               // ANYA: For Part II: how does sorting work, exactly?
               No seperate files for cells yet
  - Commit 6:  Sort direction arrow for header 
               Cell is being seperated into its own file
  * Commit 8:  Angular-cli
               Project now looks like more of the typical angular project
               New shared directory but all code is still in fse-table
               // ANYA: I think, the "typical" structure changed between 2 and 4, need to investigate
  * Commit 9:  Implement editing, sorting, navigation for FSETable
               Included bootstrap and refactored code
               Lots of styling
               Big Upgrade
  * Commit 10: fse-cell is now its own folder inside fse-table
               fse-table now has a shared folder
  - Commit 11: Moved click handling from fse-cell to fset
  - Commit 12: Selected row is now highlighted
               Implemented add/remove function to fset
  * Commit 13: Implemented search feature
               Ctrl+F on table triggers search
               Table is sorted after search
   // ANYA: good work! Need to go into technical details for Part II, explaining all technology involved, what it is, how it is incorporated in this project.

  FSET is completed. After this point it is adding tests and refactoring

  - Commit 16: Shortened class names
  - Commit 20: Introduced ng2-bootstrap
  - Commit 21: Column-selector its own component
  - Commit 22: Search bar its own component
  - Commit 24: Row adding prep
  - Commit 25: Refactoring
  * Commit 26: Row adding feature
  - Commit 28: Prep for backend
  * Commit 29: Implement connection to backend
  - Commit 30: General refactoring
  - Commit 33: Added validator for student id

// ANYA: Need a good explanation of connection to backend for Part II.

Libraries used after looking at master-
  This info can be found in `package.json` file in the master branch.
  The main ones are -
  Angular2, NPM, Gulp, Typescript, ng2-bootstrap, karma
// ANYA: explain the use of each component in Part II

Architecture of current project-
  A UML diagram for this project does not make sense. // ANYA: really? :)

  Angular projects are comprised of components. Components are collections of files
  that work together to do a very specific task. Combining several components
  together, we get the app that we are building. // ANYA: UML seems perfect for depocting this, no?
  
  The goal of this app is to create a fse-table. Therefore the master component
  for this app is called:
  `fse-table`
      - `cell`
      - `column-selector`
      - `row-adder`
      - `search-bar`
      - `table`
  The fse-table is compromised of the components listed above.
      - `shared`: this folder in fes-table is not a component but it is
                  compromised of differnt typescript files that is shared
                  between the components


fse-cell
  - Directive: FSETableInputDirective - binds enter and esc to input box
  
// ANYA: unfinished?
