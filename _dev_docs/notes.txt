Figure out what libraries have been used:
  Looked at angular4 branch in file:
    - attempted to get 'BsDropdownModule' and 'ToolTip' module from
      'ngx-bootstrap' but commented out

    - got 'NgbModule' from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap'
    - got 'ModalModule' from 'ngx-bootstrap'

    Not sure yet if needed:
    - got 'FormsModule' from '@angular/forms'
    - got 'HttpModule' and 'RequestOptions' from '@angular/http'

    - using bootstrap

Looking at master to understand thought process:
* : means important commit
- : means not so important
  * Commit 3:  Start FSETable
               Basic table that can be sorted ascending and descending order
  - Commit 4:  Integrated gulp
               Gulp can compile sass files, uglify and compress js files and
               much more. Its like pipes in bash.
  * Commit 5:  Integrated browser-sync for cells
               Cells are editable
               Curr files: fse-table.component.html, fes-table.component.ts,
               fse-table-content.ts - this is for sorting
               No seperate files for cells yet
  - Commit 6:  Sort direction arror for header
               Cell is being seperated into its own file
  * Commit 8:  Angular-cli
               Project now looks like more of the typical angular project
               New shared directory but all code is still in fse-table
  * Commit 9:  Implement editing, sorting, navigation for FSETable
               Included bootstrap and refactored code
               Lots of styling
               Big Upgrade
  * Commit 10: fse-cell is now its own folder inside fse-table
               fse-table now has a shared folder
  - Commit 11: Moved click handling from fse-cell to fset
  - Commit 12: Selected row is now highlighted
               Implemented add/remove function to fset
  * Commit 13: Implemented search feature
               Ctrl+F on table triggers search
               Table is sorted after search

  FSET is completed. After this point it is adding tests and refactoring

  - Commit 16: Shortened class names
  - Commit 20: Introduced ng2-bootstrap
  - Commit 21: Column-selector its own component
  - Commit 22: Search bar its own component
  - Commit 24: Row adding prep
  - Commit 25: Refactoring
  * Commit 26: Row adding feature
  - Commit 28: Prep for backend
  * Commit 29: Implement connection to backend
  - Commit 30: General refactoring
  - Commit 33: Added validator for student id


Libraries used after looking at master-
  This info can be found in `package.json` file in the master branch.
  The main ones are -
  Angular2, NPM, Gulp, Typescript, ng2-bootstrap, karma


Architecture of current project-
  A UML diagram for this project does not make sense.

  Angular projects are compromised of components. Components are a set of files
  that work together to do a very specific task. Combining several components
  together we get the app that we are building.

  The goal of this app is to create a fse-table. Therefore the master component
  for this app is called:
  `fse-table`
      - `cell`
      - `column-selector`
      - `row-adder`
      - `search-bar`
      - `table`
  The fse-table is compromised of the components listed above.
      - `shared`: this folder in fes-table is not a component but it is
                  compromised of differnt typescript files that is shared
                  between the components


fse-cell
  - Directive: FSETableInputDirective - binds enter and esc to input box
